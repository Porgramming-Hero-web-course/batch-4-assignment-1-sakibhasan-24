How to handle asynchronous operations using async/await over callback/promise TypeScript

### Callback

before Promises we use callback function.it makes the code hard to read and create `callback hell`.Nested callback makes code very hard to Read.

### Promises

it's maked code easy to read and handle asynchronous operations. but it's also hard to read when we have multiple promises.But it is better than callback.it avoid callback Hell

### async await

Async await is the best way to handle asynchronous operations. It's easy to read and understand. It's also easy to debug.It's build on Promises.`async` ensures that function return the `promises`.`await`is used stop to execution until the promise is resolved.
